## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This task demonstrated the practical use of a VPN in:
- Protecting online identity
- Encrypting internet traffic
- Accessing websites securely and privately

VPNs are a vital tool for cybersecurity and are especially useful in untrusted networks like public Wi-Fi. However, free VPNs may have speed, server, or data limitations, so use them wisely.
